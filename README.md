# CUDA Fractal video drawer #

CUDA GPGPU implementation of a fractal drawer. The program calculates a Julia fractal with adjustable parameters on the GPU then draws the images on the windows console using optimal number of CPU threads with a given frame rate - I know, I know.. could be openGL, but the console gives it some retro feel.
